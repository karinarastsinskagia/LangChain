pros,cons
"The plethora of integrations, excellent client support, scalability, and regular updates. Plus Lectora of course, which I will review in due course.","One might say that their platform needs to be updated and the truth is it would be great to revamp the UI."
"I like that it is reliable, and fast. Also, email notifications and automated reports are very handy.","User Interface could be better and more modern. I know this is coming, but it has not been released to me yet. Also, it would be helpful if each Org could have its own exit page."
"I like how I can customize to meet almost any customer's needs. Many other systems offered limited options for several tasks and coming up with workarounds becomes cumbersome.The admin interface needs upgrading. It's very simple and easy-to-use, which is great, but it lacks visual appeal.","I would like to see more graphical elements along with a dashboard feature tied into reporting."
"Mobile client, Flexibility for administration The new student UX","It's a very basic LMS. Don't expect any frills, but that does keep the functionality and maintenance simple. If you host it yourself, you have to contend with an older, non-intuitive, interface. If you want the more modern look and feel you have to pay Trivantis to host it. You also have to pay extra for a mobile interface. There's not really an explanation for either point, other than they want money."
"It's a very simple and easy to use LMS. There is a REST-based API for more detailed integration with courses, and other software commonly found in an office environment. Support is great, but it can take a bit for them to get back with you.",
